,Saline,062525_testWalk_NaCl_v1,36,4,1,1,1,1,3,Got across the ladder at an extremly fast pace. Video almost looks sped up. Fastest mouse time across a ladder. Tail bobbed up and down a lot but average was still normal tail height. ,0,Normal,
,Saline,062525_testWalk_NaCl_v2,61,5,3,2,1,0,8,Elogated body across rungs trying to feel out what was ahead which a lot of the time caused for more slippng. Tail does not move around as much stayed in the middle most of the way but shot up a few other times. Only stopped a couple times and not for very long ,1,Normal,
,Saline,062525_testWalk_NaCl_v4,56,3,0,1,2,0,15,Constantly stopping across the ladder but when walking at good pace. Tail is at a strong  65 degree angle and seems to be vibrating. Tail angle drops a bit when slipping and falling,2,Normal,
,Saline,062525_testWalk_NaCl_v5,60,3,0,2,1,0,18,Constatly stopping across the rungs. Tail angle is straight but does have some curvature to it. Sniffing the rungs a lot which makes me wonder if it is smelling the past mice on the rungs or what we use to clean the rungs. A lot of little steps with front paws ,2,Normal,
,Saline,062525_testWalk_NaCl_v6,44,13,4,3,1,5,13,"Stopping constantly on the rungs and even turning around for a long period of time. Even though was a slow runb when the mouse was walking it was slipping an extreme amount, the most ive seen so far. Was not really responding to the air canister and tail angle was all over the place",2,Every,
,Saline,062525_testWalk_NaCl_v7,60,12,4,1,4,3,20,stopping but not for long periods of time. Does not react to stick poking as much as other mice. Tail is very high up 90 degrees and even sometimes goes past 90 degrees ,1,Every,
,Saline,062525_testWalk_NaCl_v8,54,3,2,0,0,1,16,did not stop but was moving across the rungs slowly. The stick with this mouse worked well. Use its back feet to help ush off of the glass sometimes. ,1,Rand1,
,Saline,062525_testWalk_NaCl_v9,51,6,5,0,0,1,12,"even though was not stopped for a long time still tried to turn around on multiple occasions if not stopped by the stick. When trying to resist the stick the tail came very low almost wrapping the rungs but other then that very high tail angle 90 degrees, also climbing onto the wall and reaching to feel out what is in front ",2,Rand2,
,Saline,062525_testWalk_NaCl_v10,57,2,2,0,0,0,10,"tail is very close to the rungs and kept at a constant angle, reacted to the stick poking it but was not afraid, kept calm through the entire run, ran through the entire ladder continiously ",0,Normal ,
,Saline,062525_testWalk_NaCl_v11,34,11,3,1,4,3,7,"slipping constanly througout entire run, did not make it to the end of the ladder, only made it halfway through due to going through the runs, despite having a low tail angle slipped a lot with a low number of steps ",0,Every,
,Saline,062525_testWalk_NaCl_v12,51,2,1,0,0,1,10,"kept tail very close to rungs, was responsive to stick prods, kept sniffing up in the air maybe trying to get a sense of surrounding and maybe find a way out, again when we see low tail just to the naked eye it seems like there is not a lot of slips ",0,Normal,
,Saline,062525_testWalk_NaCl_v13,58,8,1,1,4,2,16,"stopping for long periods of time, trying to turn around during the run, and using the back legs to climb up onto the wall a lot, tail stayed very close to the rungs but would often shoot up to a 90 degree, took a lot of bunny hops with both back feet to next rung ",2,Every,
,Saline,062525_testWalk_NaCl_v14,58,8,2,2,1,3,17,"only stopped at the beginning of the run, was prodded the entire way by the stick which we probably should not have done but it got the mouse across. Tail most of the time was at a 90 degree angle up only coming down towards the middle. Lots of slips and was uneasy by the random pattern",0,Rand1,
,Saline,062525_testWalk_NaCl_v15,56,5,2,1,2,0,11,"stopped but only for small periods of time before quiclly being prodded. Not very responsive to the stick more was getting pushed. Trying to climb up the glass wall, lots of little mini bunny hops with back legs to get to rungs. Tail was low and curved",1,Rand2,
,Saline,062525_testWalk_NaCl_v16,56,7,3,1,4,0,9,stopping but only for short periods of time. Sniffing the walls a lot and the tail angle was all over the place during the entire run ,1,Every,
,Saline,062525_testWalk_NaCl_v17,49,2,0,0,2,0,7,only stopped for a short period of time. Tail was very high up and vibrating. Now looking back on the clips we used to stick way too much and did not allow them to cross willingfully. ,1,Rand1,
,Saline,062525_testWalk_NaCl_v18,48,1,1,0,0,0,6,"tail was at a 65 degree angle the entire way, no major observations",1,Rand2,
